Johns old printers become a laser cutter/cnc machine

This is the code repo for the cutter I am attempting to make from some old printer parts and a laser diode. I havent decided on the diode yet but I plan to make it modular so that I could add a bit and have a CNC machine also.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks for visiting.
